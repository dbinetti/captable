Introduction
============

Captable is an application designed to manage capitalization tables.
Typically cap tables are managed though spreadsheets written by attorneys;
however, when capitalization structures get complicated (as often happens
with multiple finacings, convertibles, options, etc.,) it becomes a serious
pain to get Excel to do what you want it to do.  I originally wrote
this app to help me decide whether to finance or sell my last company
by conducting complicated what-if analyses that I didn't want to pay
lawyers to conduct.  (For the record, I had great attorneys -- they are
just really expensive.)

I've extensively documented throughout the application so that you can
understand how different calculations are made, so if you want to learn
more about financing structure I would encourage you to read the source
code.  I've included support for the most common terms that are used in
financings with explanations throughout.

If you have any suggestions for future improvements or find bugs please
let me know.  I hope this tool will be used by entrepreneurs who are
frustrated by Excel and find code a better vehicle by which to run
financial calculations.
